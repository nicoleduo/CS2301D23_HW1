Prompts the user for how many prime numbers that they would like to receive.
Then, it gives a list with the amount of prime numbers they asked for, starting with 2 and goes in ascending order. 
Contains two functions: is_prime(int v) and main(void)

Notes:
print_prime.c must run its_prime prior to the main function

To compile:
"gcc prime_number.c"

To run:
"./a.out"

Sources: I wrote this program with the help of my sister, Jasmine Duong, who helped debug my work.
