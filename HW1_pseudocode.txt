Main
Initialize variables

Prompt user for N, the number of prime numbers to print
Get value from terminal and store in variable

Loop while the program hasn't printed all N numbers (N>0)
    initialize i as 2
    if i is prime
        print value of i
        decrease value of N by 1
    increase i by 1


is_prime function
Loop over all numbers  (x) less than the input (v)
    if the v/x is a whole number 
        then the value is not prime
        print "0" to the terminal
        Exit the loop

If v/x was never a whole number
    print "1" to the terminal
